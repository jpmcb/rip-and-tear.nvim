_In the first age_\
_In the first battle_\
_When the bloatware first lengthened_\
_One stood_
 
_He chose the path of perpetual torment_\
_In his ravenous configurations he found no peace_\
_And with boiling blood he scoured the internet_\
_Seeking vengeance against the VScoders who had wronged him_
 
_And those that tasted the bite of his keyboard bindings named him_\
_The Neovimer._
